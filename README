Writable - write on paper, no chat commands required!

A new plugin for writing and reading text on paper, with a twist of realism.
Does not require any chat commands or client modifications.

# Usage

To write, you will need paper and:

1. a writing implement (example: feather)
2. a writing surface (examples: stone or wood, not gravel or grass)
3. ink (example: dandelion yellow)

Ensure the writing implement is in your inventory hotbar, directly
next to the ink you want to write with, then while holding the paper
simply **double right-click** on a temporary writing surface present
somewhere in the environment.

A text entry dialog will appear, and you can type your story. 

To read a piece of paper, simply hold it in your hand and the text
will be displayed in the chat. 

# Support

## Writing Implements
Feathers are the most logical choice of writing instrument, but several items are supported:

* Feather
* Stick
* Blaze rod
* Arrow

All function equivalently.

## Writing Surfaces
Almost any reasonable hard surface is acceptable as a writing surface.
Think of if you could place paper on it and write on the surface
in real life. Trying to hold your paper on, say, gravel or grass, and write on it
would not be very realistic. Stone, wood, and most other solid surfaces
are allowed by default.

Currently, not all logical writing surfaces are allowed -- crafting tables,
for example, will invoke the crafting grid instead.

## Inks
* Rose Red (dark red)
* Dandelion Yellow (yellow)
* Lapis Lazuli (blue)
* Cactus Green (dark green)
* Ink Sac (black)
* Bone Meal (white)
* Cyan Dye (blue)
* Purple Dye (light purple)
* Gray Dye (dark_gray)
* Light Blue Dye (aqua)
* Pink Dye (red)
* Lime Dye (green)
* Magenta Dye (dark purple)
* Light Gray Dye (gray)
* Coal (dark gray)
* Glowstone Dust (gold)
* Redstone Dust (magic)

Inks are optionally consumed when used (consumeInk configuration option).

# Limitations

By design, the text is limited to approximately one chat window screenful
per piece of paper. After all, it is paper, not a book.

The writing is in permanent ink; it isn't erasable. To start over, you have
to use a new paper.
